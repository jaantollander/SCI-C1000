We met at the CS building to discuss the first steps of our project. After an intesive photoshoot to capture our freely flowing creative process, we soon arrived at a satisfactory title for our party: **3+4Dudes**. After some brief discussion about blog-keeping tools, we began talking about the scope of our project.

Despite our previous research finding that [LIDAR]_ is a superior tool compared to our [SFM]_ tools, one of our group with experience in a company working with SFM technique protested: the company was of the opinion that SFM offers a sufficient degree of detail while being **a lot faster and cheaper**.
