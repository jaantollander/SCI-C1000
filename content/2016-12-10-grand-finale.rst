The grand finale is finally here!

If you want to test our interactive prototype or have any questions conserning our solution and/or business model, come visit us at our stand in Aalto Undergraduate Centre's (Otakaari 1) first floor. Our team will gladly provide you with answers and coffee!

We will also have a short and informative presentation about the project around 11.20 am.
