Introduction

In outdoors GPS (Global Positioning System) developed by USA has established itself for locating objects and people. Unfortunately indoors GPS does not work often and the accuracy is not enough for many applications.There are many alternative methods for indoor navigation that are based on different technologies such as Wi-Fi station triangulation or fingerprint locating or observing Earth's magnetic field. However, the lack of unified wireless infrastructure and standardisation interferes suitability of these technologies.

A rapidly developing computing power of handheld devices enables new kinds of sophisticated solutions to locate users indoors. Structure from motion (SFM) technique called makes it possible to form the state of the 3D model based on photographs or video images taken from several different directions. The photographs are identified, described space profiling benchmarks, which formed in the point cloud by means of three-dimensional model can be constructed. When the state later taken photo or video, the camera location is possible to identify significant places each on the basis of previously generated 3D model.

Clear strength compared when SFM technology to other indoor positioning methods is that it works reliably, for example, with a standard smartphone camera. Both the formation of the model and utilization are possible with existing and affordable devices. Also, there is no need  for separately mounting expensive infrastructure in the space in which such a positioning is to be used.

The purpose of this project is to find out

- Is photograph based positioning indoor positioning system a viable option.
- Can this technology achieve adequate accuracy with  available consumer devices such as smartphone cameras?
- Who would be willing to pay for such a service, and what kind of synergies it would have, for example, with advertising, or in a context of mobile games?
- We are also investigating wheter a small-scale prototype is realistic in the conclusion of the project.


Potential Customers and End users
---------------------------------
We try to direct the main focus of the project to a solving a mundane and practical problems related to indoor positioning, so that end-users would be likely ordinary consumers. Indoor positioning technique described above  is possible to implement all the hands from devices so we can see the most commercial potential in a consumer product.

Potential customers

- Shopping malls
- Retail stores
- Museums
- Real estate agents (Virtual tours of the houses)

Aim to get as comprehensive a sample of interviews from various locations


Scope of the project
--------------------

We will make a brief statement of interest in new forms of retail outlets positioning methods, as well as interviews with customers to find out their transactions on a daily problems they encounter and more efficient positioning solutions to them can bring.

Construction technology based on the demo and documentation of the development process.

Schedule and Milestones
------------------------



Information Collecting
----------------------
Some source of information are

- Articles written about the subject
- Documentation of SFM libraries
- Data of customers is collected by interviewing consumers and companies via e-mail / phone.

The aim is to form a complete picture of the opportunities and challenges of the current state and create a relistic goal for a model and demo.
