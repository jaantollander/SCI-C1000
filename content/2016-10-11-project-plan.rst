Because the traditional 2D images are a projection of 3D world they lose valuable information of the depth. *Structure from motion* technology can reconstruct the 3D information using multiple images, without knowledge of the geometry of the camera.

Reconstructed 3D maps can be used in consumer technologies. Examples:

- Virtual and alternate reality
- Indoor navigation
   - Shopping malls, large buildings, etc
