In outdoors GPS (Global Positioning System) developed by USA has established itself for locating objects and people. Unfortunately indoors GPS does not work often and the accuracy is not enough for many applications.There are many alternative methods for indoor navigation that are based on different technologies such as Wi-Fi station triangulation or fingerprint locating or observing Earth's magnetic field. However, the lack of unified wireless infrastructure and standardisation interferes suitability of these technologies.

A rapidly developing computing power of handheld devices enables new kinds of sophisticated solutions to locate users indoors. Structure from motion (SFM) technique called makes it possible to form the state of the 3D model based on photographs or video images taken from several different directions. The photographs are identified, described space profiling benchmarks, which formed in the point cloud by means of three-dimensional model can be constructed. When the state later taken photo or video, the camera location is possible to identify significant places each on the basis of previously generated 3D model.

Clear strength compared when SFM technology to other indoor positioning methods is that it works reliably, for example, with a standard smartphone camera. Both the formation of the model and utilization are possible with existing and affordable devices. Also, there is no need  for separately mounting expensive infrastructure in the space in which such a positioning is to be used.

The purpose of this project is to find out

- Is photograph based positioning indoor positioning system a viable option.
- Can this technology achieve adequate accuracy with  available consumer devices such as smartphone cameras?
- Who would be willing to pay for such a service, and what kind of synergies it would have, for example, with advertising, or in a context of mobile games?
- We are also investigating wheter a small-scale prototype is realistic in the conclusion of the project.


Potential Customers and End users
---------------------------------
We try to direct the main focus of the project to a solving a mundane and practical problems related to indoor positioning, so that end-users would be likely ordinary consumers. Indoor positioning technique described above  is possible to implement all the hands from devices so we can see the most commercial potential in a consumer product.

One of the main customer groups are shopping centers and  major hypermarket-class shops, which could take advantage of indoor positioning to provide a better customer experience, guidance service and presentation of advertisements. In addition to shops other large public places, such as museums might be interested in the possibilities for increasing the AR-elements to improve the customer experience. Augmented Reality elements could be a way Trades signage, but also in various commercials and reconstructions provide customers with much wider than usual museum experience.

In addition to customers that utilize alternate reality it could also be used to create high-speed 3D-models of limited size at the interior, for example, the virtual presentation of the apartment. In this case, the advantage would be particularly affordability and ease of use, because modeling is based entirely on the existing technology.


Scope of the project
--------------------
We will make a brief statement of interest in new forms of retail outlets positioning methods, as well as interviews with customers to find out their transactions on a daily problems they encounter and more efficient positioning solutions to them can bring.

Construction technology based on the demo and documentation of the development process.

Schedule and Milestones
------------------------
The project schedule is set to according scheduling based on the course. We have set a deadlines for the various sub-regions as follows

Punctuality is monitored weekly meetings, which dates agreed Thursday at 10.00


Data Collecting
---------------
The collection of data is divided into two main phases: the formation of the theoretical basis based on the articles and the Making of fieldwork in the form of interviews. The first phase, the objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of technology, the opportunities and challenges as well as create a realistic idea of the level of complexity produced demo. Articles form the basis of the concepts of the interviews. The interviews will be carried out either by phone or physically on site and, depending on the location of the interviewee's schedule. The purpose of the interviews is to identify the potential customer interest in the concept and at the same time to get a new perspective for the development of the concept. The final concept and demo creation of the interviews on the basis of issues raised in the development areas.


Risks
-----
We have mapped the risks related to the project and to prepare for them as follows

Responsibilities
----------------
Our group consists of seven people, whom we have shared responsibilities roughly as follows. The division of responsibility is indicative only, and not on the basis not intended to form a significantly differing roles within the group. The idea is that each take on the role of a little more of said sub-region while the other in the best possible way of subsidies.
