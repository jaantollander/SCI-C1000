Creating the Project Blog
-------------------------
Created the project blog *(the one you are reading right now)*.

- **About** page contains some general information about the project
- **Contact** page contains information about the authors of the project.

Source code of this blog is hosted at `GitHub`_ and the blog it self is in the project `GitHub pages`_.

3D Reconstruction from Photos
-----------------------------
When taking traditional photos of 3-dimensional world, it is projected into 2-dimensional surface and the depth is lost. In order to restore this lost dimension, one way to reconstuct it is as inversion problem, meaning reconstruction from multiple images [1]_.
